# 201-lab

## Lab 2:
The purpose of the first lab was to create an about me webpage that contained a short bio about myself. There was also to be javascript added to create an about me 5 question (plus one) guessing game to demonstrate basic understanding of if/else statements, prompts, alerts, variables, and console logs. Functions, loops, and data strctures, were deliberately not used for this assignment.

## Lab 3:
Features to add:

- ~~Implement the following features using only what has been taught in class so far. No functions. No helper methods.~~
- ~~Change work experience and education parts of the bio to an unordered list.~~
- ~Add a top ten list about myself using an ordered list.~
- ~~For the guessing game, provide feedback on the responses.~~
- ~~Add a 6th question that has a numeric answer. Give user feedback on high/low guesses. Allow 4 guesses. If guesses are used up, show the correct answer.~~
- ~~Add a 7th question that has multiple answers. Store the correct answers in an array. Allow 6 guesses. Display all correct answers at the end. The game ends when user correctly guesses one of the possible answers.~~
- ~~Keep score for the guessing game. Show user number of correct answers of the total questions asked (7).~~
- ~~Use console logs to keep track of what questions have been asked.~~
- ~~Add at least one more CSS style.~~
- ~~Optional: put questions, answers, responses for first 5 questions into arrays (or array of arrays). Use for loop utilizing it.~~
- ~~Optional: Make the 6th question a random number to guess.~~
